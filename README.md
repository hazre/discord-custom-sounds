# Discord Custom Sounds

This repository contains a specific Discord message notification sound that was temporarily available during the pre-release of Discord's 2024 Halloween sound effect pack on the Canary build. The sound has been preserved here for continued use as a custom notification sound. I might add more sounds to this later on.

You can change your default sounds on Discord desktop using [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord) and the [customSounds](https://github.com/ScattrdBlade/customSounds) plugin.
